Useless_
===========

This is the homepage of useless_.


Overview of packages
---------------------
- **base** - basic modules, most useless packages depend on this one

  + This package some modules/classes/functions that are very stable, 
    a few that are changed somewhat freqeuently, and some that will be removed 
    and shouldn't be used at all.

  + This package contains a copy of the forgethtml_ module, which is 
    distributed under an LGPL license.

- **db** - database modules, these are for both postgresql and sqlite, depends on 
  sqlgen package

  + The interfaces in this package are very stable and unlikely to change for a while.  
    This package will likely be deprecated one day in favor of using sqlalchemy_.

- **kdebase** - basic pykde widgets

  + The widgets in this package are not very special, and are probably a waste of 
    time to try and use.  The interface is subject to change frequently and are 
    probably unsuitable to be used in your code.

- **kdedb** - pykde widgets for use with sql databases

  + The widgets in this package are not very special, and are probably a waste of 
    time to try and use.  The interface is subject to change frequently and are 
    probably unsuitable to be used in your code.

- **sqlgen** - this is probably the best of the useless packages, a pythonic way of 
  handling sql statements.  This package is not feature complete, but it is very useful.

  + The sqlgen package is very stable and has undergone very few changes in its 
    lifetime.  This is a nice package and works very well with the useless-db package.

Developers who might like to use this code should note that only the db and sqlgen 
packages are stable enough to be used.  The rest of the code may be useful as a 
guide or inspiration for your own code.  All of the code, with the exception of the 
forgethtml_ module is in the public domain, so you can use the code freely in your 
own projects.


Dependencies
--------------------

useless is split into multiple packages, each dependent on different packages.


-----------------------------

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

Python developers who use Postgresql_ and/or PyKDE_

----------------------

Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain useless is through subversion::

	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless


svn_ access (This will work in konqueror.)

There is also a tarball_ of the source available, thought it might be 
out of date.  Useless doesn't change too much, and the api is pretty stable,
although probably badly named.

Documentation
---------------------

The only documentation available so far, is in the code.  After installing,
run pydoc -g to browse the api documentation.


Overhaul
-------------

There has been much progress in many areas in the python community that are
making useless really useless.  The code is very likely to require python 2.5, mainly to 
use relative imports and make the packages easier to transport into other packages.  The 
db and sqlgen packages will eventually be replaced by sqlalchemy.  It is likely that I will start 
using genshi_ instead of forgethtml_ to generate html, yet genshi is somewhat slow, and 
doesn't try to insure that the html generated is valid.
