Useless_
===========

This is the homepage of useless_.


Overview of packages
---------------------
- **base** - basic modules, most useless packages depend on this one
- **db** - database modules, these are for both postgresql and sqlite, depends on 
  sqlgen package
- **debian** - some debian specific modules to help when developing on a debian system
- **gtk** - GTK+ widgets useing pygtk, this package is no longer being maintained and 
  will be dropped eventually
- **kbase** - basic pykde widgets, this section will go through a major overhaul soon
- **kdb** - pykde widgets for use with sql databases, this package needs to be overhauled
- **sqlgen** - this is probably the best of the useless packages, a pythonic way of 
  handling sql statements.  This package is not feature complete, but it is very useful.
- **webframe** - this package is used to help build websites using cherrypy and 
  forgetHTML.  A modified copy of forgetHTML a modified copy of forgetHTML is available 
  in the package.
- **xmlgen** - this package was uses xml.dom.minidom to help generate xml files.  It 
  was used to generate simple HTML before I found forgetHTML.  This package may either 
  expanded or moved to the base package.  The HTML parts will definitely be removed.

Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain useless is through subversion::

	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless


svn_ access (This will work in konqueror.)

There is also a tarball_ of the source available, thought it might be 
out of date.  Useless doesn't change too much, and the api is pretty stable,
although probably badly named.
